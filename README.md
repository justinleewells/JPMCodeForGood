JPMCodeForGood
==============
Android application written for HandsOn Central Ohio for the JP Morgan Code for Good competition.

Responsibilities
================
I wrote the back-end API and a lot of the code along with Eric Hill (ewhill).  It was written in PHP and connects to an Amazon AWS server.

The front-end was written by Jacob Shields (binaryword), Charles Ding (cding9) and Shane Dancy (sdancy10) in Java with the Android Framework SDK.

Future Implementations
======================
Since we only had 24 hours to complete the challenge there are many security concerns with the application.  Lots of changes could be implemented to the way that the security is handled and the back-end API is intended to be RESTful so a few changes could be pushed there.
